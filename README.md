# Data Structures and Class Design
### What is this?
When I was studying for interviews, I figured it would be helpful to compile everything together.
This is how I've been practicing my implementation!

### What is in here?
This repository contains all my Data Structures and other mock interview practice classes. 

## Data Structures:
#### Practice writing data structure logic
Singly linked list  
Doubly linked list  
Queues (Priority and Normal as child classes)  
Binary Search Tree
Python Stacks and Dictionaries (Didn't write logic for these since they are built-in. Just practiced implementation)

## Practice Classes
#### From Mock Interviews
`anagram.py:` Checks if two strings are anagrams of another  
`book.py:` Models a bookstore selling books  
`coin_change.py:` Classic coin change problem using greedy method  
`palindrome.py:` Simple string palindrome checker  
`card.py:` Model a credit and debit card class (Was actually asked this in the interview)  
`date_conversion.py:` Date-to-word conversion challenge
