# Data Structures
### What is this?
Since I'm studying for interviews right now, I figured it would be helpful to compile everything together.
This is how I've been practicing my implementation!

### What is in here?
This repository contains all my Data Structures logic (Python) as I've been learning them. 

##### Right now that includes:
Singly linked list  
Doubly linked list  
Queues (Priority and Normal as child classes) 
Binary Search Tree

##### It will soon include:
~~Queues (Just need to sit down and write it)~~
~~Binary Search Trees~~
Heaps
