# Data Structures
### What is this?
Since I'm studying for interviews right now, I figured it would be helpful to compile everything together.
This is how I've been practicing my implementation!

### What is in here?
This repository contains all my Data Structures and other coding logic (Python) as I've been learning them. 

##### Right now that includes:
Singly linked list  
Doubly linked list  
Queues (Priority and Normal as child classes)  
Binary Search Tree


### Practice Classes
`anagram.py:` Checks if two strings are anagrams of another  
`book.py:` Models a bookstore selling books  
`coin_change.py:` Classic coin change problem using greedy method
`palindrome.py:` Simple string palindrome checker  
`card.py:` Model a credit and debit card class (Was actually asked this in the interview)  
`date_conversion.py:` Date-to-word conversion challenge


##### It will soon include:
Heaps (Probably will not get to)
